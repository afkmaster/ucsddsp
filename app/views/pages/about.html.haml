				%p Delta Sigma Pi is a professional co-ed business fraternity founded in 1907 at the New York University: School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance by Harold Valentine Jacobs, Alexander Frank Makay, Alfred Moysello, and Henry Albert Tienken.  We are a combined aspect of both a student club and a fraternity, being structured by the dichotomy of business education and brotherhood.  Up until today, our organization has grown from coast to coast, with over 300 collegiate chapters and 235,000 members worldwide.
